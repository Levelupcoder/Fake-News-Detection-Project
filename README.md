# Fake-News-Detection-Project
Fake news detection project uses NLP &amp; ML to identify misinformation in news &amp; social media. It helps distinguish reliable from unreliable sources and prevent spread of false information by analyzing credibility, writing style &amp; content. Models are trained on known fake &amp; real news datasets.

1. Data

  The project uses a dataset of labeled news articles from Kaggle. The dataset is split into training and testing sets and pre-processed for use in the machine             learning models. The data includes text, metadata, and labels indicating whether each article is real or fake.

2. Methodology

  The project uses natural language processing techniques to analyze various factors, such as the credibility of the source, the writing style, and the content of the     article. Machine learning model such as logistic regression model is trained on the pre-processed data to identify patterns and characteristics of fake news.

3. Dependencies

  The project is built using Python and requires several dependencies, including Scikit-learn, Pandas, and NumPy.

4. Results

  The project achieves an accuracy of over 90% in identifying fake news articles.

5. Conclusion

  The Fake News Detection project is an important tool for combating the spread of fake news and improving the accuracy of information available to individuals and         organizations. It can be extended to analyze other types of media, such as social media posts and videos, and can be adapted to specific domains and use cases.
